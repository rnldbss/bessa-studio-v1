    "body": "Creative web developer, Pink Floyd fan, and dad to a gorgeous cane corso (it’s a dog). When I’m not building websites for beautiful retreat centers I wish I had the money to go to, I like to read up on the latest tech news, drink *too much* coffee, and hike with said cane corso (how many times can I mention her in this short paragraph?). Pushing the boundaries of my own creativity is important to me which is why you’ll often find me fangirling poring over quirky, unusual sites that I end up drawing inspiration from. I love exploring the work of designers from different countries and observing how culture influences our work. This means I end up bringing valuable insights to my clients, helping them increase brand visibility with out-of-the-box ideas and unique web design."
